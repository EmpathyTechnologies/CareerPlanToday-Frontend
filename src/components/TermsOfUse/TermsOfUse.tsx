      <h3>For All Users</h3>
      <div>
        Before using this site, please make sure that you note the following
        important information:
      </div>
      <h3>Do Your Own Research</h3>
      <div>
        Our content is intended to be used and must be used for information and
        education purposes only. It is very important to do your own analysis
        before making any investment, transaction, or decision based on your own
        personal circumstances. You should independently research and verify,
        any information that you find on our Website and wish to rely upon,
        whether for the purpose of making an investment, transaction, or other
        decision.
      </div>
      <h3>No Investment Advice</h3>
      <div>
        We do not provide personalized recommendations or views as to whether a
        career, college, trade school, code academy or investment approach is
        suited to the financial or other needs of a specific individual.
      </div>
      <h3>Individual Empowerment</h3>
      <div>
        This is the beginning of a journey, not the end. Where we present
        screens, calculators, or other tools, the results should only be treated
        as candidates for further research, not as recommendations. This website
        is not a substitute for independent research reflecting your individual
        criteria for your decisions. Where we offer valuation tools, these are
        solely for informational & educational purposes so that users can easily
        run their own valuations. The pre-defined values are simply a starting
        point based on assumptions. Users should not regard them as a substitute
        for their own judgment. Any resulting valuation outputs are not endorsed
        by us.
      </div>

        Accordingly, we will not be liable, whether in contract, tort (including
        negligence) or otherwise, in respect of any damage, expense or other
        loss you may suffer arising out of such information or any reliance you
